    "* The shell of a snail exhibits chirality, left-handed (sinistral) or right-handed (dextral) coil relative to the central axis \n",
    "* The Indian conch shell, Turbinella pyrum, is primarily a right-handed gastropod \n",
    "* The left-handed shells are \"exceedingly rare\"\n",
    "* So why does nature favor snails with one particular handedness?\n",
    "* Gould notes that the vast majority of snails grow the dextral form. (see S. J. Gould, \"Left Snails and Right Minds\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cliford Henry Taubes (see \"Modeling Differential Equations in Biology\") gives a simple mathematical model to predict the bias of either the dextral or sinistral forms for a given species \n",
    "* Assume that the probability of a dextral snail breeding with a sinistral snail is proportional to the product of the number of dextral snails times sinistral snails \n",
    "* Assume that two sinistral snails always produce a sinistral snail and two dextral snails produce a dextral snail\n",
    "* Assume that a dextral-sinistral pair produce dextral and sinistral offspring with equal probability\n",
    "* By the first assumption, a dextral snail is twice as likely to choose a dextral snail than a sinistral snail\n",
    "* Could use real experimental verification of the assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Model\n",
    "A model which qualitatively captures all of the above assumptions is the following.  Let $p(t)$ be the probability that a snail is dextral.  Then we describe the time evolution of this probability via the differential equation \n",
